Hey, this short work session, I completed 3 questions, two of which required very lengthy and case subjective solutions.

The most significant question out of these 3 is 

CCC '01 S1 - Keeping Score
Given the long string of input, I concluded a strategy of using four while loops for each of the suits and many variables and for loops to implement the question. However, I had to pay attention to every detail and every name of the variables as a single tiny typo could cost me an accepted solution.

Attached is proof of my accepted submission for CCC '01 S1 - Keeping Score.
