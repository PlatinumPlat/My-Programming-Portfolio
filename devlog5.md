Hey!

I completed three more questions, two of which were considerably difficult and required some extensive thinking to solve. They were both USACO problems, so they were also implementation heavy.

Here's the problem that was the most time-consuming:

Bucket Brigade (USACO):

Although the concept seems pretty simple at first, the rock placement greatly complicated the problem logic as I had to keep track of the x,y coordinates of the each of the lake, burning house, and rock. Eventually, I came up with a strategy after testing out many cases of the problem by hand. However, with the complex logic, I messed up the inequality signs and logical operators at times. In addition, I undermined the case of equal y coordinates between the lake and burning house. In the end, I was resilient and fixed all of these mistakes and reached an accepted solution!

Attached is proof of my successful submission to Bucket Brigade.
